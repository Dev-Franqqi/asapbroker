        <ul className="list-disc px-5">
            <li>Leverage: CFDs allow you to trade on margin, which means you can amplify your trading capital and potentially increase your profits. However, leverage also increases the risk of losses.</li>
            <li>Access to Global Markets: Trade a diverse range of assets from major global markets, all from a single platform.</li>
            <li>Flexibility: CFDs offer flexibility in terms of trade sizes, allowing you to trade both small and large positions.</li>
            <li>Ability to Go Long or Short: CFDs enable you to profit from both rising and falling markets, providing opportunities in any market condition.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section className="mb-3">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Risk Management</h2>
        <p>While CFD trading offers the potential for high profits, it also carries a high level of risk. It&apos;s important to manage your risk exposure by using tools like stop-loss orders and limiting the amount of leverage you use.</p>
