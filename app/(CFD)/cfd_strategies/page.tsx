                </li>
                <li><h4>Strangle:</h4>A strangle is similar to a straddle, but the call and put options have different strike prices. This strategy is used when the trader expects a large price movement but is unsure of the direction.</li>
                <li><h4>Butterfly Spread:</h4>A butterfly spread involves buying a call option at a lower strike price, selling two call options at a middle strike price, and buying another call option at a higher strike price.
