        <h3>What are CFDs?</h3>
        <p>CFDs, or Contracts for Difference, are financial derivatives that allow traders to speculate on the price movements of various assets without owning the underlying asset. Instead, traders enter into a contract with a broker to exchange the difference in the price of the asset between the time the contract is opened and when it is closed.</p>
