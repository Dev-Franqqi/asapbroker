    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Introduction to Bitcoin</h2>
    <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It was released as open-source software in 2009, and since then, it has become the first and most well-known cryptocurrency in the world.</p>
    <p>Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (fiat currencies), Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network called the blockchain. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions made with Bitcoin, ensuring transparency and security.</p>
    <p>One of the key features of Bitcoin is its limited supply. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence, making it a deflationary asset. This scarcity is one of the reasons why Bitcoin is often compared to gold as a store of value.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, meaning that while transactions are recorded on the blockchain, the identities of the parties involved are not directly revealed. This has led to Bitcoin being used for various purposes, including online payments, remittances, and as an investment asset.</p>
    <p>Overall, Bitcoin has revolutionized the way we think about money and finance. Its decentralized nature, limited supply, and borderless nature have made it a popular choice for those seeking financial freedom and a hedge against traditional financial systems.</p>

                    <p className="mt-4">
                    Our Bitcoin Spreads let you trade the price of Bitcoin (based on the trusted TeraBit IndexSM) without having to own bitcoins. There&apos;s no need for wallets or conversion, since the contracts are settled in US dollars.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-4">Best of all, it&apos;s as easy to trade price drops as it is to trade rallies. Short-selling Bitcoin is as easy as buying when you use Bitcoin Spreads.
As the price of Bitcoin varies up and down, the spread&apos;s value moves as well, but with limits. Above the ceiling or below the floor, the value of the spread stops moving and remains at its upper or lower limit (depending on whether you are a buyer or seller).</p>

<p>
In this way, your risk-reward remains within a defined range. One limit is your profit target. The other is your guaranteed protection against unlimited losses.
