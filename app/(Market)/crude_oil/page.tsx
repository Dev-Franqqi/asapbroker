                <p className="mt-3">Oil futures can make great investments and are probably one of the most actively traded derivatives on the market. Some of the benefits of investing in oil futures include:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc px-3">
                    <li>Ability to make substantial profits.</li>
                    <li>Liquidity.</li>
                    <li>Leverage.</li>

                    <p>Liquidity. Oil futures are one of the most liquid investments because of the high volume that is traded every day. In fact, they are the most actively traded future on the market and hence the most liquid.</p>

                <section className="my-4">
                    <Image className="mb-3" src={Crude_3} alt=''/>
                    <p>Leverage. You can purchase oil futures on margin (in other words, you can borrow money to purchase them). The margin requirements are set by the exchanges and for oil they are often as low as 5% of the value of the investment. That means you could buy $100,000 worth of oil futures for only $5,000. This can also be very dangerous, but it is nice to at least have options.</p>

                    <p>Limited supply. Oil is an irreplaceable resource. The fact that there is a finite supply is depressing for most people, but it can work to the advantage of investors who choose to invest in its futures. Other commodities futures such as corn and livestock can be replaced and their prices can be stabilized. However, as the worldâ€™s oil supply is exhausted, the price of oil will inevitably increase.</p>
